Hi! My name is Matias Dominguez Alonso.

 In this app I use React JS, Material UI, Bootstarp, Axios, React router / router-dom to create a login which allows you to view a table of data obtained from an API call (https://my-json-server.typicode.com/improvein/dev-challenge).

 I have decided to provide the username and password for the test of this app, but in future versions I will be implementing the creation of users with Redux.

 Thank you for letting me participate in this recruitment process!
