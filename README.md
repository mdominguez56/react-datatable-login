# React login + Material UI table connect to API ðŸš€

Hi! My name is Matias Dominguez Alonso.

_In this app I use React JS, Material UI, Bootstarp, Axios, React router / router-dom to create a login which allows you to view a table of data obtained from an API call (https://my-json-server.typicode.com/improvein/dev-challenge)._

I have decided to provide the username and password for the test of this app, but in future versions I will be implementing the creation of users with Redux.

## Start

_If you want to use the app you must follow the following steps:_

```
open project folder
```

```
npm install
```

```
npm start
```
